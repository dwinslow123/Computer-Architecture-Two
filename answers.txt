2. A TCP/IP packet is considered the basic unit of of network transmission, and they contain two 'parts' the Header and the Data. The header includes many pieces of data such as:

  Which protocol is being used (IPv4 or IPv6)
  Length of the packet
  How many packets are being used to send the total amount of data
  The source and the destination of the packet
  A checksum (used in calculating corrections)
  The 'Time to Live' (TTL), or how many times the packet can be passed before timing out

The minimum size for a TCP/IP header is 20 bytes and the maximum is 60 bytes.
